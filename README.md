# 📈 Machine Learning for Stock Trading - Neural Network Approach

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a machine learning pipeline for stock trading predictions using **neural networks**. The notebook demonstrates how to leverage historical stock data, technical indicators, and machine learning models to create a predictive trading strategy.

## 🔍 Overview

The project showcases a data-driven approach to stock trading by:
- Collecting and analyzing historical stock price data.
- Engineering features using popular technical analysis indicators.
- Training a neural network to predict stock movements.
- Backtesting the strategy to evaluate its profitability.

Using this pipeline, we attempt to forecast stock price trends and develop an automated trading strategy.

## 🚀 What’s Included

The notebook is divided into the following sections:

1. **Historical Data Collection:** Fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
2. **Technical Indicator Calculation:** Generate indicators like RSI and CCI using `pandas_ta` for feature engineering.
3. **Data Labeling:** Create labels based on forward-looking price movements to train the model.
4. **Neural Network Training:** Train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to classify stock price movements.
5. **Backtesting:** Simulate trading strategies based on model predictions and calculate cumulative returns.
6. **Prediction:** Provide a forecast for the next trading day.

## 🌟 Why This Code?

This notebook is my hands-on exploration of applying machine learning to financial markets. It is based off a Course by Genbox Gaming on Udemy. I have been able to:
- Understand the role of technical indicators in predictive modeling.
- Experiment with neural networks for financial data.
- Assess the profitability of trading strategies through backtesting.
